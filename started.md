## Getting started

To get started with Bota, you will need to get a bot token from @BotFather.

1. First, talk to @BotFather and follow a few simple steps to create a new bot.

2. You will need to obtain your authorization token, which is a string that looks like this: `110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw`.

3. Once you have your token, go to Bota website and click on Add new bot button, insert your bot token and start building your bot.

That's it! You are now ready to start building and hosting your own Telegram bots with Bota.

## Install bots from the Store

Our platform includes a Bot Store where you can browse and import pre-built bots, saving you time and effort in developing your own bot from scratch.
